# AuE-8230 Spring 2023 Group 1 - Tinker Twins

This directory hosts details of Group 1 for the course AuE-8230 during Spring 2023.

## Course Description:

**AuE-8230:** Autonomy: Science and Systems, as the name suggests, introduces students to scientific (formulations) as well as technological (ROS-based implementation) advances in the field of autonomous systems. This course is handled by [Dr. Venkat Krovi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkatnkrovi), Michelin SmartState Chair Professor of Vehicle Automation at [Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR)](https://cuicar.com/) and director of [Automation, Robotics and Mechatronics Laboratory (ARMLab)](http://cecas.clemson.edu/armlab-cuicar).

## Group Name:

**Tinker Twins:** [Chinmay Samak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samakchinmay) and [Tanmay Samak](https://in.linkedin.com/in/samaktanmay) are twin brothers, who use "Tinker Twins" as a personal brand. The twins have come a long way tinkering with various tools and technologies, which has strengthened their scientific knowledge and skills. The duo has worked on various projects ranging from microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to in-orbit space settlements, and almost everything in between. They have a particularly keen interest in the field of robotics and autonomous systems, and are specializing in the field of autonomous vehicles. The team's name was therefore decided to reflect the same brand!
